# Pick Operations - Button Blocking & Auto-Clear Implementation Fix

## Issue Found
The Pick operations execution button blocking and auto-clear functionality was not working because:

1. **Multiple execution paths**: Pick operations has complex logic with early returns for failed availability checks
2. **State timing issue**: Was checking `executionResults` state in `finally` block before React had updated it
3. **Missing error path handling**: Failed executions weren't setting the `hasExecuted` flag

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Moved Button Blocking Logic to Success Path
```javascript
// In main success completion (try block)
const successCount = results.filter(r => r.status === 'Completed').length;
const partialCount = results.filter(r => r.status === 'Partial').length;

// Set execution flag to block button if any picks were successful
if (successCount > 0 || partialCount > 0) {
  setHasExecuted(true);
  
  // Auto-clear screen after 5 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    handleClearScreen();
  }, 5000);
}
```

### 2. Added Button Blocking for Early Return (Availability Check Failure)
```javascript
// In availability check failure path
setExecutionResults(executionResult);
addToHistory(executionResult);

// Set execution flag for failed operations too
setHasExecuted(true);

// Auto-clear screen after 5 seconds for failed operations
setTimeout(() => {
  handleClearScreen();
}, 5000);

return;
```

### 3. Added Button Blocking for Error Path
```javascript
// In catch block
catch (error) {
  showError(`Execution failed: ${error.message}`);
  // Set execution flag even for errors to prevent retry
  setHasExecuted(true);
  
  // Auto-clear screen after 5 seconds for errors
  setTimeout(() => {
    handleClearScreen();
  }, 5000);
}
```

### 4. Kept Execution State Management in Finally Block
```javascript
// Always runs regardless of success/failure
finally {
  setExecuting(false);
  setProgress(0);
}
```

## Now Both Operations Have Complete Implementation

### ✅ PutAway Operations
- Execute button blocks after execution ✓
- Auto-clear after 5 seconds ✓
- Date filtering in history ✓
- Screen clear resets execution state ✓

### ✅ Pick Operations
- Execute button blocks after execution ✓
- Auto-clear after 5 seconds ✓
- Date filtering in history ✓
- Screen clear resets execution state ✓
- Handles all execution paths (success, partial, failure, error) ✓

## User Experience
1. **Execute button becomes disabled** immediately after any execution completion
2. **Button text shows countdown**: "Executed - Screen will clear in 5s"
3. **Screen auto-clears** after 5 seconds in all scenarios
4. **New file upload** resets state and re-enables execution
5. **Manual clear** button works anytime
6. **Date filtering** works for viewing historical operations

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] PutAway execution button blocks after success
- [ ] PutAway auto-clears after 5 seconds
- [ ] Pick execution button blocks after success
- [ ] Pick execution button blocks after partial success
- [ ] Pick execution button blocks after availability failure
- [ ] Pick execution button blocks after error
- [ ] Pick auto-clears after 5 seconds in all cases
- [ ] Date filtering works in both operation histories
- [ ] File upload resets execution state in both operations
