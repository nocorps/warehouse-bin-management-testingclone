## Technical Implementation Details

### State Variables Added:
```javascript
const [hasExecuted, setHasExecuted] = useState(false);
const [historyDateFilter, setHistoryDateFilter] = useState('');
```

### Execution Button Logic:
```javascript
disabled={executing || !parsedData || parsedData.items.length === 0 || hasExecuted}
{executing ? 'Executing...' : hasExecuted ? 'Executed - Screen will clear in 5s' : 'Execute [Operation]'}
```

### Auto-Clear Logic:
```javascript
// Set execution flag to block button
setHasExecuted(true);

// Auto-clear screen after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  handleClearScreen();
}, 5000);
```

### Date Filtering Logic:
```javascript
const loadHistory = async () => {
  const filters = {};
  
  if (historyDateFilter) {
    const selectedDate = new Date(historyDateFilter);
    const startOfDay = new Date(selectedDate);
    startOfDay.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
    
    const endOfDay = new Date(selectedDate);
    endOfDay.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
    
    filters.startDate = startOfDay.toISOString();
    filters.endDate = endOfDay.toISOString();
  }
  
  const history = await historyService.getOperationHistory(
    currentWarehouse.id, 
    operationType,
    filters
  );
  setExecutionHistory(history);
};
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Implementation:
- Users could accidentally click execute button multiple times
- Users had to manually clear screen after each operation
- History only showed "today's" operations by default
- No way to view operations from previous dates

### After Implementation:
- ✅ Execute button automatically blocked after execution
- ✅ Screen automatically clears after 5 seconds with visual countdown
- ✅ Users can select any date to view historical operations
- ✅ Clear date-aware messaging when no operations found
- ✅ "Show All" button to quickly reset date filter
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality

## Files Modified:
1. `src/components/PutAwayOperations_Restructured.js`
2. `src/components/PickOperations_Restructured.js`

## Dependencies Used:
- Existing `historyService.js` with date filtering capabilities
- Material-UI `TextField` with type="date" for date picker
- Existing notification system (`showSuccess`, `showError`, `showInfo`)

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test execution button blocking in both PutAway and Pick operations
2. Verify auto-clear functionality after 5 seconds
3. Test date filtering with various dates in history
4. Verify "Show All" functionality
5. Test file upload resets execution state properly
6. Ensure existing functionality remains intact
