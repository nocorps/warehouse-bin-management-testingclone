# Pick Operation Bin Locking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation prevents inventory location changes during active pick operations to ensure data consistency and avoid confusion during picking operations.

## Key Components

### 1. Bin Locking Mechanism
- **Lock Tracking**: `activePickOperations` Map tracks bins locked per warehouse
- **Operation IDs**: Unique IDs generated for each pick operation for tracking
- **Timeout Protection**: Auto-cleanup after 10 minutes to prevent stuck locks

### 2. Pick Operation Flow
```
PHASE 1: Lock bins for picking
├── Generate unique operation ID
├── Lock all bins involved in pick
└── Set auto-cleanup timeout

PHASE 2: Execute pick operations
├── Validate inventory availability
├── Update bin quantities
└── Track audit logs

PHASE 3: Release bins (always in finally block)
├── Release all bin locks
├── Clear timeout
└── Force cleanup if errors occur
```

### 3. Protection Points

#### Put-Away Operations
- Validates target bins before allocation
- Prevents conflicting put-away during picks

#### Bin Updates (warehouseService.updateBin)
- Checks for inventory-related updates
- Blocks quantity/SKU/status changes on locked bins

#### Bin Moves (warehouseService.moveBetweenBins)
- Validates both source and destination bins
- Prevents inventory transfers during picks

#### Auto-Allocation (autoAllocateQuantity)
- Excludes locked bins from allocation
- Ensures picks don't interfere with put-away

### 4. Error Messages
Clear user-friendly messages explain why operations are blocked:
```
"Cannot update bins - currently locked for active pick operation. 
Locked bins: bin1, bin2. 
Please wait for pick operation to complete or contact system administrator."
```

### 5. Safety Features

#### Automatic Cleanup
- 10-minute timeout for stuck operations
- Force release function for emergency cleanup

#### Comprehensive Validation
- Checks all bin operations against active picks
- Validates at multiple service layers

#### Atomic Operations
- Pick operations lock all bins upfront
- Release happens in finally block (guaranteed)

## Benefits

### Data Integrity
- Prevents race conditions between pick and put-away
- Ensures consistent inventory quantities
- Maintains audit trail accuracy

### User Experience
- Clear error messages explain delays
- Prevents confusing inventory discrepancies
- Protects against picker confusion

### System Reliability
- Automatic cleanup prevents stuck locks
- Multiple validation layers ensure protection
- Graceful error handling maintains operations

## Usage Examples

### Successful Pick Operation
```javascript
// Step 1: Pick operation starts
await warehouseOperations.executePick(warehouseId, taskId, pickedItems);
// Bins automatically locked and released

// Step 2: Concurrent put-away blocked
await warehouseOperations.executePutAway(warehouseId, taskId, binId, quantity);
// Throws: "Cannot put-away to bins - currently locked for active pick operation"
```

### Emergency Cleanup
```javascript
// Force release all locks for warehouse (admin function)
warehouseOperations.forceReleaseAllPickLocks(warehouseId);
```

This implementation ensures that inventory locations remain stable during pick operations, preventing data inconsistencies and operational confusion.
